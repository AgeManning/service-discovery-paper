\michal{Need a good introduction on Kademlia here. Distances/buckets etc. It's required to explain the ticket table, routing etc.}
\etienne{How different is the Ethereum Kademlia from the original published version? I can assume there have been changes in so many years. Is there a reference document for the Ethereum's Kademlia I can read?}
\sergi{From what i remember main difference are num of buckets and use of log distance.  I don't remember any document but Felix will help.}
\sergi{We should also add how kademlia is used for discovery (when lookups are performed, lookup buffer use,  pool of connections, random lookups, etc}
