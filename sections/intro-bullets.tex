\section{Introduction}
Ethereum~\cite{buterin2013ethereum}  is one of the largest permission-less (\ie open membership),  open-source  blockchains supporting Turing-complete scripting via smart contracts. 

In addition to running its own blockchain platform, Ethereum is home to third-party decentralised applications and platforms that run alternative cryptocurrencies and host various services such as content delivery. 

A vast majority of these applications require dedicated ``sub-networks'', each consisting of only the peers participating in a particular application, to enable exchange of application-specific data such as transactions, blocks, \etc to be disseminated to only the peers interested in that data. 

In order to form application-specific sub-networks, the peers must first join an (application-agnostic) Ethereum network and participate in a \textit{service discovery protocol (Discv4)} to find other live peers that are part of the desired application's sub-network. 

The Ethereum network is based on Kademlia\cite{maymounkov2002kademlia} â€“ a well-established Distributed Hash Table (DHT) implementation. 

Unlike the earlier DHT systems, Kademlia follows a flexible peer selection process that allows random sampling of peers from each distance-specific interval along the circle (where identifiers are arranged). 

Each node establishes \textit{DHT-level network connections} with a fixed number of sampled peers from each distance and also adds those peers to the corresponding (distance-specific) entry in its local routing table.

\para{State-of-the-art} Discv4 is the current \textit{service discovery mechanism} of Ethereum. Discv4 merely makes random walks (picking random destinations from the DHT id space) and forms a random sample of peers learned from \textit{encountered nodes} along the walks. 

These sample of peers are then returned to the application, which must determine each peer's supported application, \ie by initiating a handshake protocol with each peer to query their supported applications. 

Until an application forms enough application-level connections with peers of the corresponding application, it requests more peers from Discv4 to continue the \textit{exhaustive search process}.  

The randomness in the sampling of peers in both the DHT-level connections by Kademlia and application-level connections by Discv4 provides (a best-effort) Byzantine resilience in a permission-less network where financially-motivated attacks targeting individual applications are common. 

These application-level attacks use as a precursor the more basic, targeted attacks such as eclipsing where an attacker aims to fill up a peer's application-level connections with its Sybils - afterwards, an application can be fed with any custom data as part of an attack such as double-spending, stubborn mining, \etc. 

In addition to security, another major challenge facing Discv4 is the \textit{scalability}: although random peer selection provides an acceptable-level of security against eclipsing attacks, the current discovery process is rather slow in finding peers for even moderately popular applications. 

As more peers and applications join the Ethereum network, the inefficiency of brute-force discovery process is likely to become a bottleneck for the applications. 

\para{Discv5} In this work, we propose a new \textbf{service discovery layer} which enables secure,  efficient and robust  discovery of application-specific peers in the Ethereum network.
Different from Discv4, \sysname allows nodes (\ie advertisers) to associate themselves with a set of \emph{topics} (\eg application IDs), and advertise the association (\ie an ad) in the network. 

The information is collectively stored by network participants (\ie registrars) without relying on a single trusted party at any point. Any node can then query the network for a topic to obtain a list of application-specific peers and directly connect to them without disturbing other members of the network. 

We build \sysname on top of the existing Kademlia DHT to propagate application-specific advertisements to randomly-sampled nodes chosen in a way for resilience against targeted attacks.

Our design encourages diversity of advertisements stored at each registrar making the system resistant to network dynamics. At the same time, \sysname provides efficient peer discovery operations terminating within a bounded number of steps for all the topics regardless of their popularity. The protocol implements a robust admission mechanism to limit the resource usage on all the nodes, ensure fairness across topics, and prevent a vast range of malicious behaviours even in the presence of a powerful attacker.

\para{Contributions} We make the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In \Cref{sec:placement}, we design a DHT-based data placement system that distributes service advertisement in the network. The protocol combines pseudo-random data placement for security with deterministic operations for efficiency. We present a lookup operation that finds a subset of advertisement placed in the system within a bounded amount of time. The procedure ensure the diversity of data sources and is resistant against manipulation by malicious registrars. 
    \item In \Cref{sec:registration} we design a lightweight admission protocol allowing advertisers to place ads after waiting for a specified amount of time. \sysname guarantees that advertisers cannot place more advertisement by deviating from the protocol and does not create any intermediary state at nodes holding the advertisements. 
    \item In \Cref{sec:waitingTime}, we design a function that calculates a waiting time after which advertisement can be placed on nodes holding advertisements. The function limits the amount of resources used by each node, promotes ads diversity stored within nodes, and protects against a vast range of malicious behaviours. 
\end{itemize}
