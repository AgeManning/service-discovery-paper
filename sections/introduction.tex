\section{Introduction}
\michal{A new introduction proposition focusing less on Ethereum.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Centralization is bad, we need decentralized applications + all the benefits of decentralization
    \item Decentralized applications need efficient p2p networks to find peers and exchange information (+examples of blockchains, IPFS etc.)
    \item Traditionally, there's a choice between structured and unstructured P2P networks. Structured are more efficient but insecure, while unstructured are more secure but inefficient. 
    \item In this work, we attempt to breach this gap. We propose a structured P2P network that can be both secure and efficient. 
    \item Subsection Motivation example: Ethereum
    \item Contributions
    \item This paper is organised...
